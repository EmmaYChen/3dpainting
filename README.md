# Virtual Reality Project: 3D painting
### Author: Yao Chen, Jiaqi Jiang

Our project aims at creating a 3D real-time painting App where the whole world in front of the player is the canvas. With the VR controller as the brush, players could create whatever 3D models they have in mind. It could be as simple as a teddy bear and also as complex as a 3D scene.

#### Software Support

This app is designed in Unity Game Engine (Unity2018.1 or later version)

#### Hardware Support

This app is specially designed for SUMSUNG Gear VR power by Oculus. With a SUMSUNG (S6,S7,S8) smartphone and SUMSUNG Gear VR and its controller, you should be able to enjoy the interesting 3D painting and creating your own 3D art pieces.
